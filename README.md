# Beyond Diagnosis: Transdiagnostic Neuro-Behavioural Profiles of Social Cognition via Multimodal Data Integration Across Autism and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and data used in the analyses for the manuscript titled **"Beyond Diagnosis: Transdiagnostic Neuro-Behavioural Profiles of Social Cognition via Multimodal Data Integration Across Autism and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders."** It contains scripts for processing, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal data to identify biologically informed subgroups across individuals with SSD, autism, and typically developing controls (TDC) using Similiarity Network Fusion (SNF) and metaSNF.
